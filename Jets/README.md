<h2>Jets Project</h2>
<h2>Week 3 Homework</h2>

<h3>Summary</H3>
  Project was to create an inventory of jets through the use of classes and interfaces, along with ArrayLists to practice the Java code we have learned the past few weeks. Jets should vary and have different fields. A user should be able to view them and add or remove jets.

<h3>Technology used</h3>
  Git, Eclipse, Java, Abstract Classes, Classes, Interfaces, input / output, array Lists, methods, Object Oriented techniques, instantiating objects in the program and through user input.

<h3>How to Run</h3>
  From the main menu, a user can view the current inventory of Jets. Each choice returns the user to the main menu after execution. When the user is ready they can choose to quit. If the user chooses to add a jet of the types defined, those types will show for their features - i.e. a newly added fighter will join the fighter team for combat. As well, if the new jets is the fastest, it will display when 'fastest jet' is choosen from the main menu. Removed Jets behave similarly, if it is gone it is gone and no longer 'fastest' or available for missions. Any jet can be removed.

<h3> Lessons Learned </h3>
• Push early and often, so your team knows what you've got, they can't help if they don't know
• If your blueprint (i.e. class) is for an outhouse, don't expect a mansion - don't micromanage class creation, use the shortcuts, as eclipse knows what it needs
• Learned the importance of instantiating new copies to overcome the limitations of static methods, and placeing ArrayLists and Scanners in the proper place for 'global' access
